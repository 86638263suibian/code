- LogFormat
	* add timezone
	* add counter to detect replay-attacks
	* use secure, crypthographic hash-function instead of crc32
	* cryptographic signature
 


- reading data
	* the dataforwarder seems to have problems to read log-lines that were
	  created very fast (like logger line1;logger line2)
	* problems reading from device files


- security
	* use close_on_exec flag for every opened file!
	* create IV by using secret key and avoid sending it along the message
	* write pseudonymizer module
	* support chroot()
	* identify data that was created by users/attackers to protect the
	  analysis engine against false information ()
	  + like: Jan 14 22:00:26 OnoSendai thetom: this message is fake
	  + check the user-name field 

- config file
	* using SIGHUP doesnt work: "Error while parsing config file"
	  + maybe we should rewind the file
	  + reinit globals
	  + maybe switch to fles+yacc
	* some variables should not be updated
	  + filter
	  + logfiles
	  + key
	  + encryption
	  + ...

- debugging
	* SIGUSR1/2 increment/decrement debug-level
	  + test for "errno = EINTR" in LogWatch process

- synchronization of dataforwarder processes should be improved

- design
	* add another module-type to send data

- misc
	* we do not need exit(child_process)
