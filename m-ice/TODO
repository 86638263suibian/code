This file contains various jobs that need to be done, a time span, and
the name of the developer working on it.
The time span is just an estimation and is defined as followed:
	- short:	< 3 month
	- middle:	~ 6 month
	- long:		> 12month

Due to the fact that some jobs depend on others to be finished even if
they are short time goals I need to reflect that by putting these jobs
in lower rows. For example full testing doesn't make sense without
"everything" implemented so far. 
A more comprehensive schedule will be published at http://m-ice.sf.net/ .
For technical details take a look at the TODO files of every component's
directory.

Please note, that multiple developers can work on the same task.
